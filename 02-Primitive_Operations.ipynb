Python for loops are referred to as collection-based or iterator-based loops and use the concept of iterables and iterators to perform the looping operation as opposed to the index based approach used in C-style loops. Under the hood Python is actually using two built-in functions *iter()* and *next()* to implement the for loop which we can discuss in more detail in a future blog post and video.\n",

    "*Note (7)*: Even though we'll ultimately be using asymptotic analysis to model our algorithms if you're interested in examining the primitive operations being executed in a Python program in more detail you can use the *dis* module which is the disassembler for Python bytecode. This allows us to examine the set of instructions used by the Python virtual machine. A .pyc file is actually the compliled bytecode. However, for our purposes we don't need to concern ourselves with all of the under the hood details. If anyone is interested though we can also make a future blog post or video discussing the *dis* module in more detail."
